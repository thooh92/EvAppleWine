\usage{
download_fun(r_width, r_height, r_distance, filepath = getwd())
}
\arguments{
\item{r_width}{Numeric. Enter width of a vineyard or orchard row in m in fully developed vegetation}

\item{r_height}{Numeric. Enter height of a vineyard or orchard row in m in fully developed vegetation}

\item{r_distance}{Numeric. Enter distance between vineyard or orchard rows in m in fully developed vegetation}

\item{filepath}{Character. Enter path where downloaded files should be stored. Defaults to working directory.}
}
\value{
A list with all different vegetation state files for the associated geometry
}
\description{
allows to download radiation partitioning for closest vineyard or orchard geometry from database for 16 growth states during a vegetation period
These data can then be translated to a given location and given time period using \link{processing_function}
}
\details{
Radiation Partitioning was modelled for row distances between 1 and 3.5 m, row heights between 1 and 3.5 m and row widths between 0.35 and 0.55 m.
If other geometries are given to the function, the closest geometry is downloaded. If these geometries are far off the closest modelled geometry a
a warning is created.
